			<p>Some weeks ago I cooked Flying Jacob (Swedish: <a href="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flygande_Jacob" target="_blank" title="Swedish Wikipedia">Flygande Jacob</a> or <a href="http://www.recepten.se/recept/flygande_jakob.html" target="_blank" title="Recipe in Swedish">Flygande Jakob</a>) at my friends Anders&#39; &amp; Amy&#39;s place for some lovely dinner guests (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/phonophoto/sets/1081171/">pictures at flickr</a>). We had a great time, and at the end of the night I got that greatest of compliments from Marc, he asked for the recipe (he wasn&#39;t just being nice, I have since heard that he has actually even used it cooking for his friends, who also loved it).</p>
<p><del> I think this dish was &quot;invented&quot; in the 70s by a Swedish chef (if anyone knows the story, please <a href="/">contact me</a>).</del> Have since I wrote this found the answer, read full post and scroll down to have the secret revealed!</p>
<p><img alt="Flying Jacob, casserole dish, image from Wikipedia" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Flygande_jakob_fardig.jpg/220px-Flygande_jakob_fardig.jpg" /></p>
<p>Photo borrowed from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Jacob">WikiPedia</a> since I forgot to take picture of my completed masterpiece... Hope they don&#39;t mind.</p>
<p>Usually it is served as a kids&#39; dish, the savoury taste and the mix of sweet, salty and creamy makes it an easy sell I guess (and the pink color is a bit different, which I think also goes down well with our younger co-inhabitants of Earth). Every household in Sweden seems to have their own version of this dish, but this is mine.</p>

			<div class="entry-more">
				

<p>For this particular night I even made a vegan version of it, where I replaced the bacon with smoked tofu and the chicken with sweet potato (since Bunny simply loves sweet potato...).</p>
<p>Here is however the carnivore recipe. The name of the dish is &quot;Flygande Jakob&quot; [Fluugannde Iakobb] which means &quot;Flying Jacob&quot;. Don&#39;t know why really...</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> You need this for six people:</span></span></p>
<p>1 kg chicken breast<br /> 200 gr bacon<br /> 4 bananas<br /> 2 dl (200 ml) chili sauce (HP Mexican Chili is great)<br /> 5 dl (500 ml) single cream<br /> 1.5 dl (150 ml) peanuts<br /> salt and pepper<br /> rice</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> Instructions:</span></span></p>
<p>Put the rice to boil. Start the oven, 200 degrees celsius.</p>
<p>Cut the chicken to bite sized pieces. Cut the bacon to small bits, like 3x1 cm shreds. Fry the bacon first (season with pepper), put aside. Fry the chicken (season with salt and pepper), put aside.</p>
<p>(Tip: If you want to save time, buy a grilled chicken and rip to bite sized pieces instead of frying chicken breast.)</p>
<p>Mix the cream with the chili sauce.</p>
<p>Put the rice in the bottom of a pan (you know, the typical 33x25 cm oven pan). Put chicken and bacon on top. Slice two of the bananas on top of the chicken and bacon. Pour the mix of cream and chili over it all, distributing it evenly. Slice the remaining two bananas on top of the cream and sprinkle with peanuts.</p>
<p>Place pan in the middle of the oven and let it bake until the sauce gets a bit darker (ten to fiteen minutes).</p>
<p>Serve with salad. Get stuffed.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> According to my mother, the name of the &quot;inventor&quot; was Jacobsson and he was indeed Swedish. He wasn&#39;t a chef however, he worked in the air freight industry... How odd. But I guess they have kids who have to eat too?</p>
<p>Atleast that explains the name, &quot;Flygande Jacob&quot; which means &quot;Flying Jacob&quot;. But shouldn&#39;t there be a cute little story to tell to the kids, about the night daddy Jacobsson had to cook since wifey was away, and all he had was cream, bananas, ketchup and chicken? That&#39;s probably exactly how it happened.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> An acquaintance on a mailing list I am a member of (ah, the aggregate wisdom and power of Trafik truly rocks) provided the following background.</p>
<p>Excerpt from the Swedish book &quot;PÃ¥ svenska bord 1970-2000 Tidernas Mat - Nordiska Museet * Allt om mat&quot; page 137 (translation done by me):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The name of the dish hasn&#39;t got anything to do with the chicken, but comes from the name of the creator who was called Jacobsson. His daily job was in the air freight industry - hence &quot;Flying Jacob&quot;.<br /><br />This easy to make and popular dish has become a part of the Swedish household and is today also served in schools. Few people know that it originated in &quot;Allt om&#0160; mat&quot; (a well known Swedish cooking magazine // Manne); it was first published in issue 13, 1976.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there you go. Soon to celebrate its&#39; 30th birthday. The traditional recipe goes like this (from the original article):</p>
<p><strong><em>Original and traditional Swedish Flygande Jakob&#0160;</em></strong>(serves 8)</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p>4 rotisserie chickens<br />1 tsp Italian salad spice<br />4-5 bananas<br />4 dl (400 ml) double cream<br />2 dl (200 ml) &quot;ketchupish&quot; chili sauce<br />2 packages bacon<br />1 dl (100 ml) salted peanuts<br /><br />Instructions:</p>
<p>1. Set oven to 225 degrees celsius.<br /><br />2. Strip all the meat of the chickens and put in an oven pan. Taste the chicken and if needed season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the salad spice on top.<br /><br />3. Peel the bananas. Cut them first once in half and then split them length wise making four pieces of each banana. Put on top of the chicken.<br /><br />4. Whip the cream lightly and mix with the chili sauce.<br /><br />5. Distribute cream and chili mix over the chicken and banana. Bake in oven about 20 minutes.<br /><br />6. Meanwhile, cut bacon to small pieces and fry until crispy.<br /><br />7. Spread crispy bacon and peanuts over the baked chicken.</p>
<p>Serve with a salad and boiled rice.</p>
