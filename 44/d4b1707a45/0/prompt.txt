Read @CLAUDE.md , then @REDACTED.md and then take  a look at the latest comment on PR 5. Let me know what you think we should do next.

---

Go ahead with your recommendation: do the quick wins first.

---

Yes please go ahead and do that research. Hopefully there's somehting useful. If there isn't can it be seen as an acceptable risk for the MVP?

---

Your analysis sounds thorough. I am comfortable with accepting this risk. Go ahead with your recommendation for the MVP:

  1. Accept the risk for now - Document it clearly as technical debt
  2. Improve the current regex sanitizer - At minimum, add more patterns (iframe, object, embed, data:, vbscript:)
  3. Add comprehensive test cases - Test all the bypasses the reviewer mentioned
  4. Add a TODO comment - "Future: Replace with proper allowlist-based sanitizer when Workers-compatible library available"
  5. Monitor the situation - Keep an eye on isomorphic-dompurify and sanitize-html compatibility

Excallent! Is this committed? Please also include the changes that were made before to /review-pr and /review-pr-team

Did you leave a comment on the PR?

---

Honest opinion: do we need another review by our independent reviewer, or can we merge, tidy up, and move on to next phase?

---

Go ahead and merge. :)

---

Phase 2 deployed fine. Is there anything I can see on the website yet? Or is this still all foundational?

---

No, I'm fine with this. Let's move on to phase 3!

---

Looks great to me. How will you store the email that is allowed to log in? We are only talking about me, so it's only one single user email ever.

---

Please go with Option B, that is best practice in my opininon. We may be small but we don't need to look small. :)

I think you should finish the last 2 tasks (tests + docs). Can I test this on localhost?

---

Please resume.

---

I did a quick test this is ready for commit and for making a PR I think!
