Please familiarise yourself with this project by reading @CLAUDE.md and checking out the project structure. Can you tell me what this project is about?

---

Hmm. But that can't be right. The project is deployed to CloudFlare on https://hultberg.org and is serving the pages as expected.

---

Excellent. Do you need to update something in @CLAUDE.md to make this clear? If a developer comes new to the project, they should be able to read the project top level @CLAUDE.md and quickly get up to speed so they can be productive.

---

Can I somehow run this site locally for purposes of checking development changes?

---

Yes please.

---

Excellent! Let's try updating the /now page. It's the file @public/now/index.html 

First of all, make a copy of the file and save it as a backup using the same file name format at as the previous backups in the same folder, for example @public/now/index_20160926.CHANGED.html

I no longer work at Ocado Technology, so the first sentence and the first bullet in the list below need to change. I know work at char.gy (https://char.gy) where we design, manufacture, install and operate EV chargers. By strategically installing charge points along residential streets, we bring convenient, reliable, and affordable charging directly to drivers’ doorsteps.

---

There's a spelling mistake in the second bullet, change "abtch" to "batch". The age of my asparagus bed also needs to change from four years to five. And change "harvested my second batch" to "looking forward to harvesting more asparagus spears this year".

---

Third bullet also needs changing. I now work out 2 days a week while trying to repair the longitudinal splits in bicep tendons in my right arm... Over a year in the making, but slowly getting there. I hope.

---

Great! Please commit these changes (and other changes in the project, I have for example deleted two old files). The give me the command to push to GitHub.

---

Great, looks perfect. How do we work together using proper pull requests? I would like to understand how I can use you to create pull requests as well as review them.

---

Let's wait a bit, and discuss an actual new feature in the site first. And when we work on actually implementing it (after creating a specification together) we can move on to using pull requests.

---

I would like to introduce a super simple blog feature. Yes, let's talk this through, and save the plan for it as a Markdown file in @SPECIFICATIONS/ 

The blog posts should all be listed with a title and excerpt on a sub page in the site, like /updates

The title of each post should be linked to the post itself, and show the whole thing, mauybe we use a "slug" in the URL so a blog post with the title "Using Claude Code to implement a blog feature" is accessed on /updates/using-claude-code-to-implement-a-blog-feature

If two blog posts are created with the same title, a number needs to be added at the end of the slug (like -2 at the end for the post with the duplicate title).

I would like to be able to create these posts in a password protected form in an admin section (which could be located on /admin), just some "magic link" based protection for my personal email would be great.

Formatting the text entered in the form would be create. Maybe the form has a super simple editor where I can use standard buttons for formatting like headers, links, bullet lists etc. And maybe even upload images in some way.

Content should be saved as Markdown formatted json, I don't want any database backing this. Keep it super simple.

What do you think about that? Is that a good starting point? Anything else that you feel we need for the absolute basics? Any questions?

---

Great questions! I'll answer the functionality questions first, and then we can talk about the storage, I'd like to understand the options better.

It would be great to use the CloudFlare CDN for images. Is it free / included in my account? I have a subscription for "Workers Paid" in my account. I would like to upload quite large images, but on upload they should be resized to never be larger than fitting within a square of 800 by 800 picels (retaining the aspect ratio). So we can show a small version of an image in the blog post with a click to enlarge.

Metadata:
- published as well as latest edited date and time, auto generated
- yes, draft and published states, I would love to be able to work on drafts until done
- no tags for now, but that will be interesting later - add this as a future feature
- the author will always be me, so just my name and a link to the /now page

List page:
- latest post at the top of the list (on published date)
- pagination, 10 posts per page
- separate excerpt field to I can write a catchy intro, but if left empty use first 150 characters from the post

Nice to haves:
- yes to an RSS feed!
- yes to edit as well as delete
- yes to preview before publishing

With regards to design and layout, I think start with using /now as a template. It's extremely simple, but as long as we use structured and neat HTML tags we can apply a neat looking design later. You have a set of meta tags at the top, where I think it's pretty clear where data like title, dates and so on should go. There's also a tag for Google Analytics which we should keep.

Any follow up questions on that before we talk more about storage?

---

I agree with your recommendation. Let's not use the word "posts" anywhere though, let's call it "updates".

In your quick check, yes, looks good. But a question: can we make sure I can add more than one image per post?

---

I like option 2, let's go with that.

Yes, let's talk storage. I think KV storage sounds tricky. And I just thought of something else. Could we store the content (the updates themselves as json maybe, but also the images) using GitHub Pages? And still get URLs like "hultberg.org/updates/slug-here" to browse the content?

---

I love the sound of option 2! Let's do that. But the delay in publishing to the site means that it puts great emphasis on being able to work on updates and save them as drafts until done, and having a good preview. Will that be possible?

---

This sounds awesome. Put what we have said so far in a clear and well structured step by step implementation plain in the SPECIFICATIONS folder. Name the file "blog-style-updates-mvp.md". Start the file with epxlaining what the feature is.

---

I think that looks great! I'd love for us to do this using pull requests, so start a new branch before starting any implementation work. And I think the first commit to the branch should be the specification!

Any questions on the implementation approach? I agree with using resend.com for emails.
