# Full-Stack Developer PR Review

This skill provides a comprehensive pull request review from an experienced full-stack developer perspective, covering code quality, security, functionality, and best practices.

## How This Works

A single expert full-stack developer reviews the PR and provides actionable feedback.

---

## Instructions for Claude

When this skill is invoked with a PR number (e.g., `/review-pr 2`):

### Step 1: Fetch PR Context

Use GitHub CLI to gather PR information:

```bash
gh pr view 5
gh pr diff 5
gh pr view 5 --comments
```

Review the files changed, commit messages, and any existing comments.

---

### Step 2: Gather Project and Specification Context

Before reviewing, gather context about the project and any related specifications:

1. **Read project documentation** - Read `CLAUDE.md` in the repository root to understand:
  - Project architecture and structure
  - Development workflow and commands
  - Key conventions and patterns
  - Technology stack and dependencies

2. **Check PR description and commits** for references to specification files

3. **Look in SPECIFICATIONS/** directory for relevant docs

4. **Read specification files** to understand:
  - Feature requirements and goals
  - Security requirements (if security spec exists)
  - Implementation approach (if implementation plan exists)
  - Success criteria

**Common specification patterns:**
- Main spec: `SPECIFICATIONS/*-plan.md` or `SPECIFICATIONS/*-mvp.md` or `SPECIFICATIONS/requirements.md`
- Security: `SPECIFICATIONS/*-security.md`
- Implementation: `SPECIFICATIONS/*-implementation.md`

**Create a context summary** including:
- Project architecture (from CLAUDE.md)
- What is this PR supposed to achieve?
- What are the key requirements?
- What security measures were specified?
- What architectural decisions were made?

This context will be provided to the reviewer so they can evaluate whether the PR matches the project architecture and intended design.

**If no specifications found:** Reviewer will evaluate based on project architecture (from CLAUDE.md) and best practices.

---

### Step 3: Full-Stack Developer Review

Spawn a **general-purpose** subagent with this task:

**Task:** "Act as an experienced full-stack developer reviewing PR #5.

**Project Context:**
[Paste the context summary from Step 2, including project architecture from CLAUDE.md, requirements, and architectural decisions]

Review this PR comprehensively across all dimensions:

**Code Quality:**
- Is the code readable and maintainable?
- Appropriate naming conventions?
- Proper error handling?
- Code organization and structure?
- Comments where needed (but not over-commented)?

**Functionality:**
- Does this implement the requirements correctly?
- Are there bugs or logical errors?
- Edge cases handled?
- Does it actually work as intended?

**Security:**
- Any security vulnerabilities? (XSS, injection, auth bypass, etc.)
- Secrets properly managed?
- Input validation adequate?
- Authentication/authorization correct?

**Architecture & Design:**
- Fits well with existing codebase?
- Design patterns used appropriately?
- Not over-engineered or under-engineered?
- Future extensibility considered?

**Performance:**
- Any obvious performance issues?
- Appropriate use of caching?
- Database queries optimized (if applicable)?
- Resource usage reasonable?

**Testing:**
- Are tests included (if needed)?
- Test coverage adequate?
- Tests actually test the right things?

**TypeScript/Types:**
- Proper use of types (no `any` unless necessary)?
- Type safety maintained?
- Interfaces/types well-defined?

**Best Practices:**
- Follows project conventions?
- No deprecated patterns?
- Dependencies appropriate and up-to-date?
- Breaking changes documented?

**Output Format:**
- ✅ **Well Done**: What's good about this PR
- 🔴 **Critical Issues**: Must fix before merge (blocking)
- ⚠️ **Suggestions**: Should consider (not blocking)
- 💡 **Nice-to-Haves**: Optional improvements

Be specific with file:line references. Be practical and pragmatic - focus on issues that actually matter. Don't be pedantic about minor style issues if the code is otherwise solid."

Wait for the review to complete.

### Step 4: Post Results

After the review is complete:

Post the review as a comment on the PR using:

```bash
gh pr comment 5 --body "[markdown content from review]"
```

Provide user summary:
- Total issues found (critical vs suggestions)
- Clear recommendation (approve/request changes)
- Key action items
- Link to PR comment

---

## Example Usage

```
/review-pr 2
```

This will:
1. Fetch PR #2 details
2. Run full-stack developer review
3. Post comprehensive review to PR #2

---

## Tips for Best Results

- **Use for all implementation PRs** - Quick sanity check
- **Faster than multi-perspective** - ~1-2 minutes vs 3-5 minutes
- **Broad coverage** - Catches most common issues
- **Upgrade to /review-pr-team** - For critical/complex PRs needing deep analysis

---

## When to Use Which Review

**Use \****`/review-pr`**\*\*:**
- Regular implementation PRs
- Quick sanity checks
- You want fast feedback
- Standard feature work

**Use \****`/review-pr-team`**\*\*:**
- Critical infrastructure changes
- Security-sensitive features
- Major architectural decisions
- Need multiple expert perspectives

I don't feel confident the /review-pr skill actually gets all the relevant context before the reviewer starts. When I ran it now it didn't look for @CLAUDE.md where the basics of the project is explained, nor did it look for @SPECIFICATIONS/testing-strategy-plan.md which is the plan that is critical for the PR to review. Why is that? How can it be improved?

---

Just to make sure: we don't want to hard code these specific documents in the skill, we want it to work for future features as well. And the reviewer might not need to read ALL those documents, the focus should be on just enough context that is required for a good review.

Is this how you see it too?

I am thinking something like an approach where @CLAUDE.md always is read (because that's the basics), then read the PR to be reviewed (title and content), then do a listing of all files in @SPECIFICATIONS/ and read the ones that seem to make sense. And follow any links in those documents to read any linked documents that based on their name also seem to make sense...

In that way the review skill becomes future proof?

Please don't just do this for /review-pr, use the same approach also for /review-pr-team

Update both skills please, this sounds spot on.
