Go ahead with your recommendation: do the quick wins first.

Yes please go ahead and do that research. Hopefully there's somehting useful. If there isn't can it be seen as an acceptable risk for the MVP?

---

Your analysis sounds thorough. I am comfortable with accepting this risk. Go ahead with your recommendation for the MVP:

  1. Accept the risk for now - Document it clearly as technical debt
  2. Improve the current regex sanitizer - At minimum, add more patterns (iframe, object, embed, data:, vbscript:)
  3. Add comprehensive test cases - Test all the bypasses the reviewer mentioned
  4. Add a TODO comment - "Future: Replace with proper allowlist-based sanitizer when Workers-compatible library available"
  5. Monitor the situation - Keep an eye on isomorphic-dompurify and sanitize-html compatibility
