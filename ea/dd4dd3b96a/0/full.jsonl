directory for this skill: /Users/magnus/Documents/Coding/MigrateHultbergOrg/hultberg-org/.claude/skills/review-pr-team\n\n# Multi-Perspective PR Review\n\nThis skill provides comprehensive pull request review from three specialized perspectives:\n1. **Security Reviewer** - Authentication, secrets, XSS, CSRF, input validation, SQL injection\n2. **Product Manager** - Business value, market and customer fit, user experience, features, edge cases, requirements alignment\n3. **Senior Architect** - Design patterns, scalability, maintainability, tech debt, suitability for autonomous LLM agents, 100% code coverage\n\n## How This Works\n\nThree independent reviews are conducted **sequentially**:\n- Each reviewer analyzes the PR from their unique perspective\n- Reviews are independent (no bias from seeing others' feedback)\n- All findings are synthesized and posted to the PR\n- Conflicts or overlaps between reviews are highlighted\n\n---\n\n## Instructions for Claude\n\nWhen this skill is invoked with a PR number (e.g., `/review-pr-team 1`):\n\n### Step 1: Fetch PR Context\n\nUse GitHub CLI to gather PR information:\n\n```bash\ngh pr view $ARGUMENTS\ngh pr diff $ARGUMENTS\ngh pr view $ARGUMENTS --comments\n```\n\nReview the files changed, commit messages, and any existing comments.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Gather Specification Context\n\nBefore reviewing, check if there are related specification documents in `SPECIFICATIONS/`:\n\n1. **Check PR description and commits** for references to specification files\n2. **Look in SPECIFICATIONS/** directory for relevant docs\n3. **Read specification files** to understand:\n  - Feature requirements and goals\n  - Security requirements (if security spec exists)\n  - Implementation approach (if implementation plan exists)\n  - Success criteria\n\n**Common specification patterns:**\n- Main spec: `SPECIFICATIONS/*.md` or `SPECIFICATIONS/requirements.md`\n- Security: `SPECIFICATIONS/*-security.md`\n- Implementation: `SPECIFICATIONS/*-implementation.md`\n\n**Create a context summary** including:\n- What is this PR supposed to achieve?\n- What are the key requirements?\n- What security measures were specified?\n- What architectural decisions were made?\n\nThis context will be provided to each reviewer so they can evaluate whether the PR matches the intended design.\n\n**If no specifications found:** Note this and reviewers will evaluate based solely on best practices.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Security Review (Subagent 1)\n\nSpawn a **general-purpose** subagent with this task:\n\n**Task:** \"Act as a security specialist reviewing PR #$ARGUMENTS for security issues.\n\n**Specification Context:**\n[Paste the context summary from Step 2, including security requirements if specified]\n\nFocus on:\n\n**Authentication & Authorization:**\n- Are credentials/secrets properly protected?\n- Are authentication flows secure?\n- Is authorization checked on all protected endpoints?\n\n**Input Validation:**\n- Is user input validated and sanitized?\n- Are there SQL injection, XSS, or command injection risks?\n- Are file uploads validated (type, size)?\n\n**Data Protection:**\n- Are secrets stored securely (not in code)?\n- Is sensitive data encrypted/hashed appropriately?\n- Are API keys and tokens handled correctly?\n\n**CSRF & Session Management:**\n- Is CSRF protection implemented?\n- Are cookies configured securely (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)?\n- Is session management robust?\n\n**Dependencies:**\n- Are new dependencies from trusted sources?\n- Any known vulnerabilities in added packages?\n\n**Output Format:**\n- ✅ **Secure Practices**: What's done well\n- 🔴 **Critical Issues**: Must fix before merge\n- ⚠️ **Warnings**: Should fix, not blocking\n- 💡 **Suggestions**: Nice-to-haves\n\nBe specific with file:line references.\"\n\nWait for the security review to complete.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Product Manager Review (Subagent 2)\n\nSpawn a **general-purpose** subagent with this task:\n\n**Task:** \"Act as a product manager reviewing PR #$ARGUMENTS for product quality and user experience.\n\n**Specification Context:**\n[Paste the context summary from Step 2, including feature requirements and success criteria]\n\nFocus on:\n\n**Requirements Alignment:**\n- Does this PR match the stated goals/requirements?\n- Are all acceptance criteria met?\n- Is anything out of scope or missing?\n\n**User Experience:**\n- Is the feature intuitive and user-friendly?\n- Are error messages clear and helpful?\n- Is the UI/UX consistent with existing patterns?\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n- Are edge cases handled (empty states, errors, etc.)?\n- What happens when things go wrong?\n- Are loading states and feedback clear?\n\n**Completeness:**\n- Is the feature fully functional?\n- Are there half-finished parts?\n- Is documentation updated (if needed)?\n\n**Future Impact:**\n- Does this create technical debt?\n- Will this be easy to extend later?\n- Any backward compatibility issues?\n\n**Output Format:**\n- ✅ **Well Done**: What meets/exceeds expectations\n- 🔴 **Blocking Issues**: Must address before ship\n- ⚠️ **Concerns**: Should address, worth discussing\n- 💡 **Enhancements**: Ideas for improvement\n\nBe specific with examples and file references.\"\n\nWait for the product review to complete.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Senior Architect Review (Subagent 3)\n\nSpawn a **general-purpose** subagent with this task:\n\n**Task:** \"Act as a senior software architect reviewing PR #$ARGUMENTS for design quality and long-term maintainability.\n\n**Specification Context:**\n[Paste the context summary from Step 2, including architectural decisions and implementation approach]\n\nFocus on:\n\n**Architecture & Design:**\n- Does this fit well with existing architecture?\n- Are design patterns used appropriately?\n- Is the code organization logical?\n\n**Code Quality:**\n- Is the code readable and well-structured?\n- Are functions/components properly sized?\n- Are naming conventions clear and consistent?\n\n**Scalability & Performance:**\n- Will this perform well under load?\n- Are there potential bottlenecks?\n- Is caching/optimization appropriate?\n\n**Maintainability:**\n- Is the code easy to understand and modify?\n- Are abstractions appropriate (not over/under-engineered)?\n- Are there code smells or anti-patterns?\n\n**Testing:**\n- Is test coverage adequate?\n- Are the right things being tested?\n- Are tests maintainable?\n\n**Technical Debt:**\n- Does this introduce debt?\n- Does it pay down existing debt?\n- Are shortcuts documented and justified?\n\n**Output Format:**\n- ✅ **Architectural Strengths**: Good design decisions\n- 🔴 **Critical Issues**: Fundamental problems to fix\n- ⚠️ **Design Concerns**: Worth reconsidering\n- 💡 **Suggestions**: Ways to improve design\n\nBe specific with code examples and file:line references.\"\n\nWait for the architecture review to complete.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Synthesize and Post Results\n\nAfter all three reviews are complete:\n\n1. **Analyze findings across all reviews:**\n  - Identify overlapping concerns (mentioned by multiple reviewers)\n  - Flag conflicts (if reviewers disagree)\n  - Highlight critical issues that appear in multiple perspectives\n\n2. **Create unified summary:**\n\n```markdown\n## Comprehensive PR Review - Multiple Perspectives\n\n### 🔴 Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Merge)\n\n[List all critical issues from all reviewers, grouped by theme]\n[Mark with [Security], [Product], or [Architecture] badges]\n[Note if multiple reviewers flagged the same issue]\n\n### ⚠️ Warnings & Concerns (Should Address)\n\n[List warnings from all reviewers, grouped by theme]\n\n### ✅ Strengths & Good Practices\n\n[Highlight what all reviewers praised]\n\n### 💡 Suggestions for Improvement\n\n[Compile suggestions, note if multiple reviewers suggested similar improvements]\n\n### 📊 Review Summary\n\n- **Security Review**: [X critical, Y warnings, Z suggestions]\n- **Product Review**: [X critical, Y warnings, Z suggestions]\n- **Architecture Review**: [X critical, Y warnings, Z suggestions]\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:** [Clear merge/don't merge recommendation based on critical issues]\n\n---\n\n*Reviews conducted by specialized subagents: Security Specialist, Product Manager, Senior Architect*\n```\n\n3. **Post the synthesized review** as a comment on the PR using:\n\n```bash\ngh pr comment $ARGUMENTS --body \"[markdown content from above]\"\n```\n\n4. **Provide user summary:**\n  - Total critical issues found\n  - Key themes across reviews\n  - Clear next steps\n  - Link to PR comment\n\n---\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```\n/review-pr-team 1\n```\n\nThis will:\n1. Fetch PR #1 details\n2. Run security review (sequential)\n3. Run product review (sequential)\n4. Run architecture review (sequential)\n5. Synthesize all findings\n6. Post comprehensive review to PR #1\n\n---\n\n## Tips for Best Results\n\n- **Use on non-trivial PRs** - Overkill for typo fixes\n- **Run before final approval** - Catch issues early\n- **Read individual reviews** - Each perspective provides unique value\n- **Address critical issues first** - Don't merge with red flags\n\n---\n\n<!-- NOTE: This is NOT part of the skill instructions -->\n\n## Future Enhancement: Parallel Execution (Option A)\n\n**Current implementation:** Reviews run sequentially (one after another)\n- Security → Product → Architecture\n- Total time: ~3-5 minutes depending on PR size\n\n**Future upgrade:** Agent Teams for parallel execution\n- All three reviewers analyze simultaneously\n- Total time: ~1-2 minutes (faster)\n- Requires: `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` in settings\n\n**When agent teams feature is stable**, this skill can be upgraded to spawn parallel reviewers instead of sequential ones. The skill structure and review criteria would remain the same—only the execution model changes.\n\n**To upgrade later:**\n1. Enable experimental flag in `.claude/settings.json`\n2. Modify Step 2-4 to spawn teammates instead of sequential subagents\n3. Teammates review in parallel\n4. Main agent still synthesizes results\n\nThe sequential approach works perfectly fine for now and proves the concept.\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"3b2cd296-40b5-408a-852a-c5e17426f0bc","timestamp":"2026-02-15T16:52:46.193Z"}

This is an API error saying the model \"sonnet\" is not found.\n\nLooking at the skill definition, I can see it spawns general-purpose subagents in Steps 3, 4, and 5. When spawning these agents using the Task tool, there's an optional `model` parameter that can be set to \"sonnet\", \"opus\", or \"haiku\".\n\nThe error message suggests that the model identifier \"sonnet\" is not being recognized by the API. This could be because:\n\n1. The model parameter is being passed incorrectly\n2. The model name needs to be a full model ID rather than a shorthand\n3. There's an issue with how the skill is configured\n\nWait, let me look at the Task tool definition more carefully:\n\n```\n\"model\": {\"description\": \"Optional model to use for this agent. If not specified, inherits from parent. Prefer haiku for quick, straightforward tasks to minimize cost and latency.\", \"enum\": [\"sonnet\", \"opus\", \"haiku\"], \"type\": \"string\"}\n```\n\nSo \"sonnet\", \"opus\", and \"haiku\" should be valid values. But the API is saying the model \"sonnet\" is not found.\n\nActually, looking at my background info, I can see:\n- I'm powered by \"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\"\n- The most recent frontier model is \"claude-opus-4-5-20251101\"\n\nSo the actual model IDs are full strings like \"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\", not just \"sonnet\".\n\nHowever, the Task tool's schema says it accepts \"sonnet\", \"opus\", \"haiku\" as enum values, so there should be some translation happening between those shorthand names and the full model IDs.\n\nThe error is coming from the API, suggesting that when the Task tool tries to spawn a subagent, it's passing \"sonnet\" to the API, but the API doesn't recognize that shorthand.\n\n\nThis could indicate a bug in the Claude Code CLI where shorthand model names aren't being translated to full model IDs, or a version mismatch where the API expects different identifiers. The skill definition itself doesn't appear to explicitly set a model parameter in the Task calls—it's just markdown instructions—so the issue likely stems from how the CLI handles the model parameter when executing the skill.\n\nSince the user already ran it and encountered the error, the skill execution must have already begun. The most probable cause is that somewhere in the implementation, the model is being set to \"sonnet\" explicitly, but the current API version doesn't accept that shorthand format.\n\nThe fix would involve either removing the model parameter entirely to inherit from the parent context, using a different model identifier, or ensuring the translation layer properly converts shorthand names to full model IDs. The error message showing `\"model: sonnet\"` indicates the API received the literal string \"sonnet\" without proper conversion to a complete model identifier, even though the Task tool schema should support these shortcuts. There's likely a gap in how the Claude Code CLI translates these abbreviated names before sending requests to the API. making the API call. If that translation isn't happening, that's a bug in Claude Code.\n\nMy recommendation should be:\n1. Don't specify the model parameter on Task calls - let it inherit\n2. This appears to be a bug in how Claude Code translates model shorthand names\n3. Report this to the Claude Code team\n\nBut actually, I should check - is there anywhere in the skill definition where model is being specified? Let me read it again...\n\nNo, the skill instructions don't mention setting a model parameter at all. So if I were executing this skill, I wouldn't be setting the model parameter unless I decided to do so on my own.\n\nUnless... maybe the skill system itself is adding model parameters? Or maybe there's a default somewhere?\n\nI think the best response is to explain that \"sonnet\" isn't a valid model identifier for the API, and when spawning subagents with Task, either omit the model parameter entirely or use the full model ID like \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\". This could be a configuration issue within the skill itself or potentially a translation bug in Claude Code. I can offer to help debug and fix the skill if needed.","signature":"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

maintainability, tech debt, suitability for autonomous LLM agents, 100% code coverage\n\n## How This Works\n\nThree independent reviews are conducted **sequentially**:\n- Each reviewer analyzes the PR from their unique perspective\n- Reviews are independent (no bias from seeing others' feedback)\n- All findings are synthesized and posted to the PR\n- Conflicts or overlaps between reviews are highlighted\n\n---\n\n## Instructions for Claude\n\nWhen this skill is invoked with a PR number (e.g., `/review-pr-team 1`):\n\n### Step 1: Fetch PR Context\n\nUse GitHub CLI to gather PR

2: Gather Specification Context\n\nBefore reviewing, check if there are related specification documents in `SPECIFICATIONS/`:\n\n1. **Check PR description and commits** for references to specification files\n2. **Look in SPECIFICATIONS/** directory for relevant docs\n3. **Read specification files** to understand:\n  - Feature requirements and goals\n  - Security requirements (if security spec exists)\n  - Implementation approach (if implementation plan exists)\n  - Success criteria\n\n**Common specification patterns:**\n- Main spec: `SPECIFICATIONS/*.md` or `SPECIFICATIONS/requirements.md`\n- Security: `SPECIFICATIONS/*-security.md`\n- Implementation: `SPECIFICATIONS/*-implementation.md`\n\n**Create a context summary** including:\n- What is this PR supposed to achieve?\n- What are the key requirements?\n- What security measures were specified?\n- What architectural decisions were made?\n\nThis context will be provided to each reviewer so they can evaluate whether the PR matches the intended design.\n\n**If no specifications found:** Note this and reviewers will evaluate based solely on best practices.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Security Review

directory for this skill: /Users/magnus/Documents/Coding/MigrateHultbergOrg/hultberg-org/.claude/skills/review-pr-team\n\n# Multi-Perspective PR Review\n\nThis skill provides comprehensive pull request review from three specialized perspectives:\n1. **Security Reviewer** - Authentication, secrets, XSS, CSRF, input validation, SQL injection\n2. **Product Manager** - Business value, market and customer fit, user experience, features, edge cases, requirements alignment\n3. **Senior Architect** - Design patterns, scalability, maintainability, tech debt, suitability for autonomous LLM agents, 100% code coverage\n\n## How This Works\n\nThree independent reviews are conducted **sequentially**:\n- Each reviewer analyzes the PR from their unique perspective\n- Reviews are independent (no bias from seeing others' feedback)\n- All findings are synthesized and posted to the PR\n- Conflicts or overlaps between reviews are highlighted\n\n---\n\n## Instructions for Claude\n\nWhen this skill is invoked with a PR number (e.g., `/review-pr-team 1`):\n\n### Step 1: Fetch PR Context\n\nUse GitHub CLI to gather PR information:\n\n```bash\ngh pr view 1\ngh pr diff 1\ngh pr view 1 --comments\n```\n\nReview the files changed, commit messages, and any existing comments.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Gather Specification Context\n\nBefore reviewing, check if there are related specification documents in `SPECIFICATIONS/`:\n\n1. **Check PR description and commits** for references to specification files\n2. **Look in SPECIFICATIONS/** directory for relevant docs\n3. **Read specification files** to understand:\n  - Feature requirements and goals\n  - Security requirements (if security spec exists)\n  - Implementation approach (if implementation plan exists)\n  - Success criteria\n\n**Common specification patterns:**\n- Main spec: `SPECIFICATIONS/*.md` or `SPECIFICATIONS/requirements.md`\n- Security: `SPECIFICATIONS/*-security.md`\n- Implementation: `SPECIFICATIONS/*-implementation.md`\n\n**Create a context summary** including:\n- What is this PR supposed to achieve?\n- What are the key requirements?\n- What security measures were specified?\n- What architectural decisions were made?\n\nThis context will be provided to each reviewer so they can evaluate whether the PR matches the intended design.\n\n**If no specifications found:** Note this and reviewers will evaluate based solely on best practices.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Security Review (Subagent 1)\n\nSpawn a **general-purpose** subagent with this task:\n\n**Task:** \"Act as a security specialist reviewing PR #1 for security issues.\n\n**Specification Context:**\n[Paste the context summary from Step 2, including security requirements if specified]\n\nFocus on:\n\n**Authentication & Authorization:**\n- Are credentials/secrets properly protected?\n- Are authentication flows secure?\n- Is authorization checked on all protected endpoints?\n\n**Input Validation:**\n- Is user input validated and sanitized?\n- Are there SQL injection, XSS, or command injection risks?\n- Are file uploads validated (type, size)?\n\n**Data Protection:**\n- Are secrets stored securely (not in code)?\n- Is sensitive data encrypted/hashed appropriately?\n- Are API keys and tokens handled correctly?\n\n**CSRF & Session Management:**\n- Is CSRF protection implemented?\n- Are cookies configured securely (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)?\n- Is session management robust?\n\n**Dependencies:**\n- Are new dependencies from trusted sources?\n- Any known vulnerabilities in added packages?\n\n**Output Format:**\n- ✅ **Secure Practices**: What's done well\n- 🔴 **Critical Issues**: Must fix before merge\n- ⚠️ **Warnings**: Should fix, not blocking\n- 💡 **Suggestions**: Nice-to-haves\n\nBe specific with file:line references.\"\n\nWait for the security review to complete.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Product Manager Review (Subagent 2)\n\nSpawn a **general-purpose** subagent with this task:\n\n**Task:** \"Act as a product manager reviewing PR #1 for product quality and user experience.\n\n**Specification Context:**\n[Paste the context summary from Step 2, including feature requirements and success criteria]\n\nFocus on:\n\n**Requirements Alignment:**\n- Does this PR match the stated goals/requirements?\n- Are all acceptance criteria met?\n- Is anything out of scope or missing?\n\n**User Experience:**\n- Is the feature intuitive and user-friendly?\n- Are error messages clear and helpful?\n- Is the UI/UX consistent with existing patterns?\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n- Are edge cases handled (empty states, errors, etc.)?\n- What happens when things go wrong?\n- Are loading states and feedback clear?\n\n**Completeness:**\n- Is the feature fully functional?\n- Are there half-finished parts?\n- Is documentation updated (if needed)?\n\n**Future Impact:**\n- Does this create technical debt?\n- Will this be easy to extend later?\n- Any backward compatibility issues?\n\n**Output Format:**\n- ✅ **Well Done**: What meets/exceeds expectations\n- 🔴 **Blocking Issues**: Must address before ship\n- ⚠️ **Concerns**: Should address, worth discussing\n- 💡 **Enhancements**: Ideas for improvement\n\nBe specific with examples and file references.\"\n\nWait for the product review to complete.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Senior Architect Review (Subagent 3)\n\nSpawn a **general-purpose** subagent with this task:\n\n**Task:** \"Act as a senior software architect reviewing PR #1 for design quality and long-term maintainability.\n\n**Specification Context:**\n[Paste the context summary from Step 2, including architectural decisions and implementation approach]\n\nFocus on:\n\n**Architecture & Design:**\n- Does this fit well with existing architecture?\n- Are design patterns used appropriately?\n- Is the code organization logical?\n\n**Code Quality:**\n- Is the code readable and well-structured?\n- Are functions/components properly sized?\n- Are naming conventions clear and consistent?\n\n**Scalability & Performance:**\n- Will this perform well under load?\n- Are there potential bottlenecks?\n- Is caching/optimization appropriate?\n\n**Maintainability:**\n- Is the code easy to understand and modify?\n- Are abstractions appropriate (not over/under-engineered)?\n- Are there code smells or anti-patterns?\n\n**Testing:**\n- Is test coverage adequate?\n- Are the right things being tested?\n- Are tests maintainable?\n\n**Technical Debt:**\n- Does this introduce debt?\n- Does it pay down existing debt?\n- Are shortcuts documented and justified?\n\n**Output Format:**\n- ✅ **Architectural Strengths**: Good design decisions\n- 🔴 **Critical Issues**: Fundamental problems to fix\n- ⚠️ **Design Concerns**: Worth reconsidering\n- 💡 **Suggestions**: Ways to improve design\n\nBe specific with code examples and file:line references.\"\n\nWait for the architecture review to complete.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Synthesize and Post Results\n\nAfter all three reviews are complete:\n\n1. **Analyze findings across all reviews:**\n  - Identify overlapping concerns (mentioned by multiple reviewers)\n  - Flag conflicts (if reviewers disagree)\n  - Highlight critical issues that appear in multiple perspectives\n\n2. **Create unified summary:**\n\n```markdown\n## Comprehensive PR Review - Multiple Perspectives\n\n### 🔴 Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Merge)\n\n[List all critical issues from all reviewers, grouped by theme]\n[Mark with [Security], [Product], or [Architecture] badges]\n[Note if multiple reviewers flagged the same issue]\n\n### ⚠️ Warnings & Concerns (Should Address)\n\n[List warnings from all reviewers, grouped by theme]\n\n### ✅ Strengths & Good Practices\n\n[Highlight what all reviewers praised]\n\n### 💡 Suggestions for Improvement\n\n[Compile suggestions, note if multiple reviewers suggested similar improvements]\n\n### 📊 Review Summary\n\n- **Security Review**: [X critical, Y warnings, Z suggestions]\n- **Product Review**: [X critical, Y warnings, Z suggestions]\n- **Architecture Review**: [X critical, Y warnings, Z suggestions]\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:** [Clear merge/don't merge recommendation based on critical issues]\n\n---\n\n*Reviews conducted by specialized subagents: Security Specialist, Product Manager, Senior Architect*\n```\n\n3. **Post the synthesized review** as a comment on the PR using:\n\n```bash\ngh pr comment 1 --body \"[markdown content from above]\"\n```\n\n4. **Provide user summary:**\n  - Total critical issues found\n  - Key themes across reviews\n  - Clear next steps\n  - Link to PR comment\n\n---\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```\n/review-pr-team 1\n```\n\nThis will:\n1. Fetch PR #1 details\n2. Run security review (sequential)\n3. Run product review (sequential)\n4. Run architecture review (sequential)\n5. Synthesize all findings\n6. Post comprehensive review to PR #1\n\n---\n\n## Tips for Best Results\n\n- **Use on non-trivial PRs** - Overkill for typo fixes\n- **Run before final approval** - Catch issues early\n- **Read individual reviews** - Each perspective provides unique value\n- **Address critical issues first** - Don't merge with red flags\n\n---\n\n<!-- NOTE: This is NOT part of the skill instructions -->\n\n## Future Enhancement: Parallel Execution (Option A)\n\n**Current implementation:** Reviews run sequentially (one after another)\n- Security → Product → Architecture\n- Total time: ~3-5 minutes depending on PR size\n\n**Future upgrade:** Agent Teams for parallel execution\n- All three reviewers analyze simultaneously\n- Total time: ~1-2 minutes (faster)\n- Requires: `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` in settings\n\n**When agent teams feature is stable**, this skill can be upgraded to spawn parallel reviewers instead of sequential ones. The skill structure and review criteria would remain the same—only the execution model changes.\n\n**To upgrade later:**\n1. Enable experimental flag in `.claude/settings.json`\n2. Modify Step 2-4 to spawn teammates instead of sequential subagents\n3. Teammates review in parallel\n4. Main agent still synthesizes results\n\nThe sequential approach works perfectly fine for now and proves the concept.\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"69e491ca-64ce-4614-ba98-1b3c37b5c1e5","timestamp":"2026-02-15T16:55:37.328Z"}

This might have a model configuration that's overriding things.\n\nLet me read both that settings file and verify the SKILL.md file was actually saved correctly.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":6850,"cache_read_input_tokens":29380,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":6850},"output_tokens":4,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYACwtV1fDTKSA8bwQXTy","type":"assistant","uuid":"813585a7-edc6-473b-b303-bda7b5e7954a","timestamp":"2026-02-15T16:56:19.552Z"}

Let me check what's in there.\n\nActually, I should also suggest that the user try restarting Claude Code or reloading the skill, since skill definitions might be cached.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":14,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1653,"cache_read_input_tokens":36230,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1653},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYACxn1riMiEyJPmywef5","type":"assistant","uuid":"59a9f0e9-29e8-490e-941f-84d093973c20","timestamp":"2026-02-15T16:56:33.300Z"}
