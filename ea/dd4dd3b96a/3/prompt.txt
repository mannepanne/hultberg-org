Hello! Please catch up on @CLAUDE.md and @REDACTED.md to refresh your memory on what we are about to embark on.

I think we are ready to begin. We've done a lot of discussions already, and even used the /review-pr-team skill to thoroughly go through the thinking in the plan. You can catch up on that in the comments on the first PR if you think it's useful.

The first thing I think you should do is verify that we are in a good position to create a new feature branch for the first step, the blog foundaiton. We want to deliver this work in clear steps, with a strong pull request at end of each so the work can be reviewed.

Make sense? What will you call the first feature branch for step 1?

Yes please, go ahead! Very exciting!
