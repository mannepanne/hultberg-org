  "content": "According to the medical journal the Lancet, heat extremes caused an estimated 546,000 deaths every year between 2012 and 2021 a 63% rise on rates seen in the 1990s.\n\nThat's the equivalent of a fully loaded jumbo jet full of people going down once every seven hours throughout the year, says Prof Ollie Jay.\n\n![iStock_000009101521Small](/images/updates/test-of-images/istock_000009101521small.jpg)\n\nAnd the really important thing to keep in mind is that every heat related death is preventable.\n\nJay is the director of the Heat and Health Research Centre at the University of Sydney, the home of the Thermal Ergonomics Laboratory a chamber the size of a big bedroom where the temperature and humidity can be tightly controlled.\n\n![logos-restaurants](/images/updates/test-of-images/logos-restaurants.jpg)\n\nSo what does extreme heat do to the body? What does it feel like to take a walk in the kind of heat that will become all too frequent in the very near future?\n\nMe and my 51-year-old body are here to find out. I'm going to go into the climate room twice. The first time, it's going to be 43C and 18% humidity the sort of conditions we'll see a lot more of in place like Sydney, Mexico City and Sao Paulo when global warming gets to 2C. That might only be a couple of decades away.![iStock_000009101521Small](/images/updates/test-of-images/istock_000009101521small.jpg)",
